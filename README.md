# Unreal Engine Deathmatch Gamemode

## Game Concept

This is a game where multiple players can connect to the same game and compete against eachother in a deathmatch style gamemode

In this game, players will be able to:

1. Host or join a game
2. Wall run
3. Shoot and kill other players until the timer runs out


## Wall running

Players can wall run across various points on the map and fire weapons while doing so. 
*Note: The viewpoint of the player is in third person. The option for first person wall running will be updated and enabled in future updates*


## Map

The map created is a custom map using features from many games such as Destiny and Titanfall. 

## Updates

*Updates to this project will be added and discussed here*
