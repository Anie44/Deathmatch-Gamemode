# Unreal Engine Deathmatch Gamemode

## Game Concept

This is a game where multiple players can connect to the same game and compete against eachother in a deathmatch style gamemode

In this game, players will be able to:

1. Host or join a game
2. Various movement techniques
3. Shoot and kill other players until the timer runs out


## Parkour Movement

Players can use various movement techniques such as sprinting, crouching, sliding, wall running, and mantling.

This game project is currently only available in third person however, animations for each movement is provided.

*Note: The development of the parkour movement was made easier by DavieDev on YouTube*

## Map

The map created is a custom map using features from many games such as Destiny and Titanfall. 
Like most of this project, the map is a work in progress. Updated pictures will be uploaded here for easier viewing access.
